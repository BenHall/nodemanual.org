<h3>The Difference Between Core Libraries and User-Submitted Modules</h3>

<p>Occasionally, in the discussions in the Node.js mailing lists and IRC channels, you may hear things referred to as "node-core" and "userland".</p>

<p>Of course, traditionally, "userland" or "userspace" refer to everything outside the operating system kernel. In that sense, Node.js itself is a "userland" program.</p>

<p>However, in the context of Node.js, "core" refers to the modules and bindings that are compiled into Node.js.  In general, they provide a hook into very well-understood low-level functionality which almost all networking programs require: TCP, HTTP, DNS, the file system, child processes, and a few other things. If something is fancy enough to argue about, there's a good chance it won't be part of node-core. HTTP is about as big as it gets, and if it wasn't so popular, it'd certainly not be a part of Node.js.</p>

<p>There are also some things in node-core that are simply too painful to do within a JavaScript environment, or which have been created to implement some browser object model (BOM) constructs which are not part of the Javascript language, but may as well be (e.g., <code>setTimeout()</code>, <code>setInterval()</code>, and <code>console</code>).</p>

<p>Everything else is "userland".  This includes: npm, express, request, coffee-script, mysql clients, redis clients, and so on.  You can often install these programs using <a href="http://npmjs.org/">npm</a>.</p>

<p>The question of what is properly "node-core" and what belongs in "userland" is often debated.  In general, Node.js is based on the philosophy that it should <strong>not</strong> come with "batteries included."  It is easier to move things out of node-core than it is to move them in, which means that core modules must continually "pay rent" in terms of providing necessary functionality that nearly everyone finds valuable.</p>

<h4>This is a Good Thing.</h4>

<p>One goal of Node's minimal core library is to encourage people to implement things in creative ways, without forcing their ideas onto everyone. With a tiny core and a vibrant user space, we can all flourish and experiment without the onerous burden of having to always agree all the time.</p>

<h4>Userland Isn't Less</h4>

<p>If anything, it's more. Building functionality in userland rather than in the node-core means:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have a lot more freedom to iterate on the idea.</li>
<li>Everyone who wants your module can install it easily enough (if you publish it with npm).</li>
<li>You have freedom to break Node.js conventions if that makes sense for your use case.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you believe that something <strong>really</strong> just <em>needs</em> to be part of node's core library set, you should <em>still</em> build it as a module!  It's much more likely to be pulled into node-core if people have a chance to see your great ideas in action, and if its core principles are iterated and polished and tested with real-world use.</p>

<p>Changing functionality that is included in node-core is very costly.  We do it sometimes, but it's not easy, and carries a high risk of regressions.  Better to experiment outside, and then pull it into node-core once it's stable.  Once it's available as a userland package, you may even find that it's less essential to node-core than you first thought.</div></p></div>
