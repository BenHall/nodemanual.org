<h2>Node Package Manager</h2>

<p>The npm, short for Node Package Manager, is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js modules; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with the online repository that aids in package installation, version control, and dependency management.  Most Node.js libraries and applications are published on npm, and there's already a plethora of third-party developed libraries to help your Node.js workflow move more easily. You can be search for these applications on <a href="http://search.npmjs.org">the npm registry</a>. </p>

<p>Before working with the npm, you'll need to install the command line tool. You can follow the instructions on <a href="http://npmjs.org/">the official npm website</a> for more information. </p>

<h4>Local Install</h4>

<p>Once you have a third-party package you want to install, it can be installed with a single line command. Let's say you're hard at work one day, you come across a problem, and you decide that it's time to use that cool library you keep hearing about. npm is very simple to use: you only have to run <code>npm install cool_module</code> on the command line, and the specified module will be installed in the current directory under <code>./node_modules/</code>.  Once installed to your <code>node_modules</code> folder, you'll be able to <a href="#what-is-require">use <code>require()</code> on them</a>, just as if they were built-ins to Node.js.</p>

<p>Local installs allow you to import Node.js modules specific to the project you're working on. If you move to another project, and need the same library, you'll have to call <code>npm</code> on the package once more.</p>

<h4>Global Install</h4>

<p>There's also the concept of a "global" install. Let's say we want to globally install the <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script">Coffescript Node.js package</a>. The npm command for a global install is simple: <code>npm install coffee-script -g</code>. This will install the program and put a symlink to it into your <code>/usr/local/bin/</code> directory (for Unix, anyway). Now, any project you create can depend on the coffee-script module, without the need for multiple local installs.</p>

<p>Some modules also depend on the global install to add a command-line tool. In this case, running <code>coffee</code> allows you to use the coffee-script command line interface.</p>

<h4>Managing Dependencies</h4>

<p>Another important use for npm is dependency management.  When you have a Node.js project with a <a href="#what-is-the-file-package-json">package.json</a> file, you can run <code>npm install</code> from the project root; npm then installs all the dependencies listed in the package.json. This makes installing a Node.js project from a git repo much easier! For example, <code>vows</code>, one of Node's testing frameworks, can be installed from git, and its single dependency, <code>eyes</code>, can be automatically handled:</p>

<pre><code>git clone <a href='https://github.com/cloudhead/vows.git'>https://github.com/cloudhead/vows.git</a>
cd vows
npm install
</code></pre>

<p>After running those commands, you will see a <code>node_modules</code> folder containing all of the project dependencies specified in the package.json.</div></p>

<h3>Accessing Module Package Info</h3>

<p>There are many situations in the world of software development where using the wrong version of a dependency or submodule can cause all sorts of pain and anguish. Node.js has a module available called <code>pkginfo</code> that can help keep these sorts of troubles at bay.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at pkginfo. First, install it via npm:</p>

<pre><code> npm install pkginfo
</code></pre>

<p>Now all we need to do is require it, and then invoke it:</p>

<pre><code> var pkginfo = require('pkginfo')(module);

 console.dir(module.exports);
</code></pre>

<p>This shows us the entire contents of the package.json, neatly displayed to the console.  If we only wanted certain pieces of information, we can just specify them like so:</p>

<pre><code> var pkginfo = require('pkginfo')(module, 'version', 'author');

 console.dir(module.exports);
</code></pre>

<p>And only the fields we specify will be shown to us.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/indexzero/node-pkginfo">the GitHub repo for pkginfo</a>.</div></p>

<h3>The Difference Between Core Libraries and User-Submitted Modules</h3>

<p>Occasionally, in the discussions in the Node.js mailing lists and IRC channels, you may hear things referred to as "node-core" and "userland".</p>

<p>Of course, traditionally, "userland" or "userspace" refer to everything outside the operating system kernel. In that sense, Node.js itself is a "userland" program.</p>

<p>However, in the context of Node.js, "core" refers to the modules and bindings that are compiled into Node.js.  In general, they provide a hook into very well-understood low-level functionality which almost all networking programs require: TCP, HTTP, DNS, the file system, child processes, and a few other things. If something is fancy enough to argue about, there's a good chance it won't be part of node-core. HTTP is about as big as it gets, and if it wasn't so popular, it'd certainly not be a part of Node.js.</p>

<p>There are also some things in node-core that are simply too painful to do within a JavaScript environment, or which have been created to implement some browser object model (BOM) constructs which are not part of the Javascript language, but may as well be (e.g., <code>setTimeout()</code>, <code>setInterval()</code>, and <code>console</code>).</p>

<p>Everything else is "userland".  This includes: npm, express, request, coffee-script, mysql clients, redis clients, and so on.  You can often install these programs using <a href="http://npmjs.org/">npm</a>.</p>

<p>The question of what is properly "node-core" and what belongs in "userland" is often debated.  In general, Node.js is based on the philosophy that it should <strong>not</strong> come with "batteries included."  It is easier to move things out of node-core than it is to move them in, which means that core modules must continually "pay rent" in terms of providing necessary functionality that nearly everyone finds valuable.</p>

<h4>This is a Good Thing.</h4>

<p>One goal of Node's minimal core library is to encourage people to implement things in creative ways, without forcing their ideas onto everyone. With a tiny core and a vibrant user space, we can all flourish and experiment without the onerous burden of having to always agree all the time.</p>

<h4>Userland Isn't Less</h4>

<p>If anything, it's more. Building functionality in userland rather than in the node-core means:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have a lot more freedom to iterate on the idea.</li>
<li>Everyone who wants your module can install it easily enough (if you publish it with npm).</li>
<li>You have freedom to break Node.js conventions if that makes sense for your use case.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you believe that something <strong>really</strong> just <em>needs</em> to be part of node's core library set, you should <em>still</em> build it as a module!  It's much more likely to be pulled into node-core if people have a chance to see your great ideas in action, and if its core principles are iterated and polished and tested with real-world use.</p>

<p>Changing functionality that is included in node-core is very costly.  We do it sometimes, but it's not easy, and carries a high risk of regressions.  Better to experiment outside, and then pull it into node-core once it's stable.  Once it's available as a userland package, you may even find that it's less essential to node-core than you first thought.</div></p>

<h3>Understanding the File Package JSON</h3>

<p><span class="cite">by Nico Reed (Last Updated: Aug 26 2011)</span></p>

<p>All NPM packages contain a file, usually in the project root, called <code>package.json</code>. This file holds various metadata relevant to the project.  It's used to give information to <code>npm</code> that allows it to identify the project, as well as handle the project's dependencies. It can also contain other metadata such as a project description, the version of the project in a particular distribution, license information, even configuration data&mdash;all of which can be vital to both <code>npm</code> and to the end users of the package. The <code>package.json</code> file is normally located at the root directory of a Node.js project.</p>

<p>Node.js itself is only aware of two fields in the <code>package.json</code>:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "name" : "barebones",
  "version" : "0.0.0",
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>name</code> field should explain itself: this is the name of your project. The <code>version</code> field is used by NPM to make sure the right version of the package is being installed. Generally, it takes the form of <code>major.minor.patch</code> where <code>major</code>, <code>minor</code>, and <code>patch</code> are integers which increase after each new release. </p>

<p>For a more complete package.json, we can study the <code>underscore</code> module:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "name" : "underscore",
  "description" : "JavaScript's functional programming helper library.",
  "homepage" : "<a href='http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/'>http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/</a>",
  "keywords" : ["util", "functional", "server", "client", "browser"],
  "author" : "Jeremy Ashkenas &lt;<a href='mailto:jeremy@documentcloud.org'>jeremy@documentcloud.org</a>&gt;",
  "contributors" : [],
  "dependencies" : [],
  "repository" : {"type": "git", "url": "git://github.com/documentcloud/underscore.git"},
  "main" : "underscore.js",
  "version" : "1.1.6"
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, there are fields for the <code>description</code> and <code>keywords</code> of your projects. This helps people who find your project understand what it is in just a few words. The <code>author</code>, <code>contributors</code>, <code>homepage</code> and <code>repository</code> fields can all be used to credit the people who contributed to the project, show how to contact the author/maintainer, and give links for additional references. </p>

<p>The file listed in the <code>main</code> field is the main entry point for the libary; when someone runs <code>require(&lt;library name&gt;)</code>, <code>require()</code> resolves this call to <code>require(&lt;package.json:main&gt;)</code>. </p>

<p>The <code>dependencies</code> field is used to list all the dependencies of your project that are available on <code>npm</code>. When someone installs your project through <code>npm</code>, all the dependencies listed will be installed as well.  Additionally, if someone runs <code>npm install</code> in the root directory of your project, it will install all the dependencies to <code>./node_modules</code>.</p>

<p>It is also possible to add a <code>devDependencies</code> field to your <code>package.json</code>. These are dependencies not required for normal operation, but required or recommended if you want to patch or modify the project.  If you built your unit tests using a testing framework, for example, it would be appropriate to put the testing framework you used in your <code>devDependencies</code> field.  To install a project's <code>devDependencies</code>, simply pass the <code>--dev</code> option when you use <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>For even more options, you can look through the <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/json.md">online docs</a>, or run <code>npm help json</code>.</div></p></div>
