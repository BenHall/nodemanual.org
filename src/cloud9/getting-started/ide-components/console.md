## The Console

In this article, you'll learn about the functionality of the console and command-line. The command-line is placed at the bottom of the IDE and shows the console when it is expanded. The Console displays valuable information and response from the system on actions performed by the user. The command-line interface enables the user to interact with the system. You can type commands to perform a typical task.

#### Available Commands
You can use most Unix commands in the console space. To preview the full list of basic commands in the console, you can type `help` and press Enter. For every command, a description is provided:

You can also use mercurial commands (`hg`) and git commands (`git`) to communicate with the system and your favorite add-on services. Typing `hg` or `git` shows the complete list of commands that are available for these services. For more information about these commands, please check their respective documentation:

* [Mercurial Command List](http://mercurial.selenic.com/guide)
* [Git Command List](http://help.github.com/git-cheat-sheets)

To use mercurial commands on the project you are working on, you must have a mercurial project set up. The same holds true for git. Follow these links to learn more about how to set up these project in Cloud 9:

These articles also explain how to use the command-line to push and commit your work.

#### Output:

The output tab in the console shows information whenever a user is running or debugging a program. The content will be similar to the output of a terminal you are used to but it will be in the same window as your editor. No need to juggle between windows anymore!

The output tab also displays the error and additional information that can improve your coding quality. You can use the console to output results from your running application, just like a regular terminal.
