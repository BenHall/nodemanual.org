## The Dashboard

From the dashboard you can edit your profile and manage projects and organization.

After you have logged in as a user you will be directed to the dashboard of your Cloud9 IDE account. The dashboard consists of two contexts: user context and organization context.

#### User Context
In the left-top corner your username is displayed. Within the user context, you can view your user profile by clicking on 'Your Account' that is placed on top in the left-side panel.

The user profile contains:

* Your recent activities, a list of actions you have recently performed within the system, like cloning, opening and closing projects
* Add-on services, a list of services you use a lot to login instantly to Cloud9 IDE. Adding such a service will enable you to access your projects. The list may contain <a title="GitHub" href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> and/or <a title="Bitbucket" href="http://www.bitbucket.org"">Bitbucket</a>
* Account settings, where you can configure the following settings:
    * Change your password
    * Change your email
    * Show your SSH key
    * Upgrade to premium
    * Enter promotion code
    * Delete your account
    

The gravatar that is used for your profile is handled by gravatar.com. If you donâ€™t have a gravatar yet, Cloud 9 IDE uses its default:

Under 'Your Account' in the left panel, there is a tab called **PROJECTS**. This contains all the projects you added to Cloud 9 IDE. The list will be sorted by Groups depending on your account settings. The groups are:</p>
* My Projects
* Shared Projects
* Organization Projects
* Projects on GitHub (public and private)
* Projects on Bitbucket (public and private)

Clicking the plus sign next to **MY PROJECTS**  allows you to:

* Create a new project
* Clone from URL

#### Organization Context
Within this context you can organize members to certain projects you want to collaborate on. Creating a project is the same as in user's context. You can remove and add members to your organization by clicking the plus or minus sign in the bottom-left of the dashboard.

After you have added members to your organization you can add them to a certain project. You can click on a member and select the project to collaborate on.
