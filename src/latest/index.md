# Node.js

This website offers a complete, community driven resource for learning and developing Node.js applications.

<i>Node.js is a platform built on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/" target="_blank">Chrome's JavaScript runtime</a> for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.</i></br />
<i style='padding-left:50px'>- From the official [Node.js website](http://nodejs.org)</i>

This site consists of 3 parts. The Node.js reference helps you with the core Node.js API. The Node.js manual contains articles to help you get started with Node.js. The Javascript reference helps you deal with the core Javascript API.

This website is a community effort and is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/c9/nodemanual.org). We expect the reference portion of the site to expand with API's of popular Node.js modules and extensions. The Node.js manual will grow with more articles on the Node.js core, tooling and modules. You can help! By writing/updating articles and issueing pull requests. Use the [edit] links near articles to edit them directly in Cloud9 IDE.
