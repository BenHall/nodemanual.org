## Introduction



Node.js is a server-side Javascript environment. It's event-driven, asynchronous, and allows you to write a web server in a relatively quick amount of time.

The purpose of this document is to provide a resource for developers of all levels&mdash;beginning, intermediate, and advanced&mdash;with a consolidated set of Node.js tutorials and best practices. The origin of this document comes from [Nodejitsu](http://docs.nodejitsu.com/), the [Node.js Wiki](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki), and various other Node.js community-driven documentation. Why this guide, then? Well, for starters, you can instantaneously import the code samples here into you [Cloud 9 IDE](http://c9.io) account and run them live.

In order to get Node.js, you can either download [the latest stable release](http://nodejs.org/#download), or clone the version submitted into the GitHub repo. Keep in mind that stable releases are even-numbered (0.2, 0.4, 0.6), while unstable releases are odd (0.3, 0.5).

If you're new to Node.js or Javascript, you may want to review the article on [asynchronous programming](#how-to-write-asynchronous-code), [designing callbacks](#what-are-callbacks), and [defining event emitters](#what-are-event-emitters). Otherwise, you might want to review what Node.js offers in its constructs through the article on [Javascript conventions](#javascript-conventions).&lt/div>
